# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in Java with Spring Boot

This project implements Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities in a Java Spring Boot application. It currently uses [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for OCR, with plans to add additional OCR engines in the future.

## Features
- **OCR functionality:** Extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR.
- **Spring Boot integration:** Provides a RESTful API for uploading images and extracting text.
- **Modular design:** Easily extendable to integrate additional OCR engines.
